  <h2>A PRT guide to understanding Parahumans</h2>

  <h3>Report authored by Watchdog for the PRT</h3>

  <p>60 years ago, the Golden Man aka Scion showed up hovering over the Atlantic Ocean. first contact noted that he was "extremely sad" like he had exxperienced a great loss. We now know what exactly this came to be after the events of Gold Morning two weeks ago, contained in a brief codename <a href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Morning" target="_blank"> ABX-32QJ</a></p>

  <p>Scion is believed to tbe the source of powers, and it was immediately after his appearance over the Atlantic that humans started manifesting abilities.</p>

  <p>The PRT has over the years managed to classify these into 12 groups:</p>

    <li>Shakers</li>
    <li>Masters</li>
    <li>Strangers</li>
